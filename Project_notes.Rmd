Agreagar lat and log to the bat2021_v2 database.

Then, the predictors matrix for the population analysis section is calculated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/15/2023

I tried copying the lat and log but there seems to be a problem as points are not plotting correctly. There might be problems with the coordinates. Update: I tried again and the elevatr package loaded and worked. However, I didn't display any elevation.\
I tried the package raster and plotted the DEM for Idaho and was able to obtain elevation for each site.

\
For the population analysis I want to include moon phase, moon illumination, elevation, riparian veg.

The riparian vegetation I will calculate with the NDVI. Unfortunately, is not working as it is. I am using  a code that is in the cleanup script. ChatGPT helped me generate it, but still not working well.

Per recommendation of Jen I created the matrix lano_js that should be use to run the model in the script pop_model. We will be using just a single species data set for testing right now. To the file lano_js we remove last week and the site column. We also made 0 data because we didn't wanted.

I just noticed that when I write a file with the write.csv function there's a there's a new index column created that has a number for each row. How to prevent this?

write.csv(iris, file = "iris.csv", row.names = FALSE)

you have to set the row.names=false argument.

I ran the data work but got an error anyway.

```{r}
urn-in + Update 1 (30000)Error in checkForRemoteErrors(val) :

  5 nodes produced errors; first error:

Error parsing model file:

syntax error on line 44 near "}"
```

I think there's something wrong with the model when we feed it to JAGS.

we fixed this.

I talked to Jen Cruz, and she mentioned I have to be careful with the things that I include in the GitHub. For example, I should not trace the R project where I am working. I should just use trace the changes in the scripts. According to her tracing the project could break cause trouble in the future.

-   I worked on the bat_pop_analysis.R script. I have organized the Lano, slc, and obs. cov, so they have no site column, and they are arranged in ascending order of week.

-   I created this R mark notebook to take notes of the thing here instead of a Word document.

-   Created obs.cov2 for moon. illumination

-   started building the plotting code. got a margina plot for elevation but not for light or dark.

-   need to calculate weather variables.

-   need to calculate NDVI

-   I meet with Jen she mentioned that the models did not converged so I increase the max number of iterations to one million. the results still not converged...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   I need to build the weather data base to run the pop models.
-   Problems with the model :\
    ![m1 diag plot](figures/m1_diag_plot.png){width="848"}

-There are several peaks for density plot. This means there's problems with identifiability because there are multiple plots in the posterior?\
-the chains are not in the same space. This means they are getting stuck in the same spot right?

When I increased to two million the Rhat values decreased? does this mean we are approaching convergence?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

12/19/2023

meeting with Jen:

-   The model is still not converging. We change the random intercept for abundance from site to week. It seems there is great variability in bat activity between weeks (see lano_js.csv). One solution might be to select certain weeks to be the ones that we analyze. Another solution is to add an extra level to the model to account for availability.

-   I ran into a problem with the data from 2021 for bats. The raw data produced with the script build data base v3 and v4. Currently the 2021 data has only 13 sites. It should be 14 because one site is missing entirely from the data base. I intended to update the data base with new code to get all the data points. Unfortunately it seems I am not collecting all the output files from Sonobat (Data_CumulativeSonoBatch_v420). I am in the process of compiling them but making a list of all the txt files using the function list.files() take a long time. So I am using the function dir_ls() from the fs package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

01/23/2023

In the code build_data_base_v4 I was able to see what what happening with the bat 2021 data.
  - some files have not been analyzed with sonobat and are missing from the database
  - once all the .txt files in the 2021 folder are compiled, there are two ways of getting the data out.   
    - sonofiles1<- sm3dirs[grepl("_CumulativeSonoBatch_v420.txt", sm3dirs)]
    - sonofiles2<- sm3dirs[grepl("SonoBatch_v420.txt", sm3dirs)] # this one doubles the data as it also get all the cumulativesonobatch files. I will be using the first one.
