Agreagar lat and log to the bat2021_v2 database.

Then, the predictors matrix for the population analysis section is calculated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/15/2023

I tried copying the lat and log but there seems to be a problem as points are not plotting correctly. There might be problems with the coordinates. Update: I tried again and the elevatr package loaded and worked. However, I didn't display any elevation.\
I tried the package raster and plotted the DEM for Idaho and was able to obtain elevation for each site.

\
For the population analysis I want to include moon phase, moon illumination, elevation, riparian veg.

The riparian vegetation I will calculate with the NDVI. Unfortunately, is not working as it is. I am using  a code that is in the cleanup script. ChatGPT helped me generate it, but still not working well.

Per recommendation of Jen I created the matrix lano_js that should be use to run the model in the script pop_model. We will be using just a single species data set for testing right now. To the file lano_js we remove last week and the site column. We also made 0 data because we didn't wanted.

I just noticed that when I write a file with the write.csv function there's a there's a new index column created that has a number for each row. How to prevent this?

write.csv(iris, file = "iris.csv", row.names = FALSE)

you have to set the row.names=false argument.

I ran the data work but got an error anyway.

```{r}
urn-in + Update 1 (30000)Error in checkForRemoteErrors(val) :

  5 nodes produced errors; first error:

Error parsing model file:

syntax error on line 44 near "}"
```

I think there's something wrong with the model when we feed it to JAGS.

we fixed this.

I talked to Jen Cruz, and she mentioned I have to be careful with the things that I include in the GitHub. For example, I should not trace the R project where I am working. I should just use trace the changes in the scripts. According to her tracing the project could break cause trouble in the future.

-   I worked on the bat_pop_analysis.R script. I have organized the Lano, slc, and obs. cov, so they have no site column, and they are arranged in ascending order of week.

-   I created this R mark notebook to take notes of the thing here instead of a Word document.

-   Created obs.cov2 for moon. illumination

-   started building the plotting code. got a margina plot for elevation but not for light or dark.

-   need to calculate weather variables.

-   need to calculate NDVI

-   I meet with Jen she mentioned that the models did not converged so I increase the max number of iterations to one million. the results still not converged...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   I need to build the weather data base to run the pop models.
-   Problems with the model :\
    ![m1 diag plot](figures/m1_diag_plot.png){width="848"}

-There are several peaks for density plot. This means there's problems with identifiability because there are multiple plots in the posterior?\
-the chains are not in the same space. This means they are getting stuck in the same spot right?

When I increased to two million the Rhat values decreased? does this mean we are approaching convergence?
